    <h3>
      General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you have given consent for data processing, we process your personal
      data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (General Data Protection
      Regulation) or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if special categories of data
      are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO. In the case of explicit
      consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
      processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have
      given consent for the storage of cookies or access to information on your
      device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally
      based on § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your
      data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the
      implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on
      Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, we process your data if it is
      necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c
      DSGVO. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our
      legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The relevant
      legal bases for the specific cases are explained in the following
      paragraphs of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
      entities. In some cases, it is necessary to transmit personal data to
      these external entities. We only disclose personal data to external
      entities when it is required for contract fulfillment, when we are legally
      obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), when we
      have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO in the
      disclosure, or when another legal basis allows for data disclosure. When
      using data processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers
      based on a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint
      processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
    </p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent for Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
      consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time.
      The lawfulness of data processing carried out before the revocation
      remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Marketing
      (Art. 21 DSGVO)
    </h3>
    <p>
      IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE
      THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME
      FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, INCLUDING PROFILING
      BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING
      IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO
      LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE
      COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR
      INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION,
      EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA.
      1 DSGVO).
    </p>
    <p>
      IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING,
      YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
      DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING, INCLUDING
      PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF
      YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
      PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2
      DSGVO).
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to
      lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the
      member state where they usually reside, work, or where the alleged
      violation occurred. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to
      other administrative or judicial remedies.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
      of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or
      to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request
      the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be
      done to the extent technically feasible.
    </p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>
      Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to
      obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
      recipient, and the purpose of data processing at any time and, if
      necessary, a right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose, as
      well as for any other questions regarding personal data, you can contact
      us at any time.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
      personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right
      to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
        usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination,
        you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, you can request the
        restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
        exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to
        request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
        of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a
        balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is
        not yet clear whose interests outweigh the interests, you have the right
        to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data -
      apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for
      the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection
      of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
      important public interest of the European Union or a member state.
